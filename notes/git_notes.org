Git

* Undo committed changes
After making some changes and having committed those changes, we want to undo the committed changes.

#+begin_src sh
git revert <commit>
#+end_src

* Undo uncommitted changes

Reset all files to the previous commit
#+begin_src sh
git reset --hard
#+end_src

* Amend the previous commit

If committed prematurely

#+begin_src sh
git commit --amend
#+end_src
