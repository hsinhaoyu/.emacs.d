* Git cheatsheet

** Amend the previous commit, change the commit message

If committed prematurely

#+begin_src sh
git commit --amend -m "bla bla"
#+end_src

** Undo committed changes
After making some changes and having committed those changes, we want to undo the committed changes.

#+begin_src sh
git revert <commit>
#+end_src

** Undo uncommitted changes

Reset all files to the previous commit
#+begin_src sh
git reset --hard
#+end_src

** condense a series of commits into one single commit using soft reset

Use soft reset to set MASTER to a previous commit state, then commit again. Everything in between is a single commit

#+begin_src sh
git reset --soft <commit>
#+end_src

** forgot to start a new branch, and committed changes to the master branch.
To retrospectively start a new branch:
- create the branch
- reset --soft master origin/master
